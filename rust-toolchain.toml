# We use a specific toolchain revision to ensure our tests - which
# occasionally depend on specific compiler output - remain stable
# for all developers until the toolchain is explicitly advanced.
# The intent is to keep this updated as new stable versions are relased.
#
# While updating this file, please also update the version in the Rust
# `trybuild-tests` CI job.
